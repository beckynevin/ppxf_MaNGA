    "I've made SDSS images at z=0.03 for two different merger simulations, for 8 snapshots in each simulation spread throughout the merger. Each snapshot has Sunrise data for 7 isotropically-distributed viewing angles (labeled 'camera[0-6]').\n",
    "\n",
    "A file broadband_[xxx].fits is generated for each snapshot (designated by snapshot number). It contains a lot of hdu's with data about the simulation setup, but the main one's you'll be interested in are:\n",
    "\n",
    "'FILTERS', which contains total magnitudes and luminosities (integrated over the whole image) for each filter and viewing angle. \n",
    "\n",
    "'CAMERA[N]-BROADBAND', which are data cubes of dimension [300 pixels] x [300 pixels] x [5 sdss filters]  and contain the actual images\n",
    "\n",
    "'CAMERA[N]-BROADBAND-NONSCATTER', which are the same as above, but for the emission *without* any scattering or attenuation by dust. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation q0.5_fg0.3_allrx10 is a mass ratio 0.5 merger with an initial gas fraction of 0.3, and both galaxies are initially bulgeless disks. The simulation q0.5_fg0.3_BT0.2_allrx10 is a very similar setup, but with a stellar bulge in each progenitor galaxy with a bulge-to-total mass ratio of 0.2. The BH merger happens at ~ snapshot 210 in the first simulation, and ~ snapshot 220 in the second. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I'm including one file from the first simulation with the full IFU data cubes so you can see the data format and start playing around with it if you like. The file is named 'mcrx_200.fits' (mcrx is shorthand for 'monte carlo radiative transfer'). This is the output of the radiative transfer calculation, with full SEDs for each pixel and each camera angle. These 'mcrx' files are what is processed by the code to produce the 'broadband' files with the broadband images. The most relevant HDU's in this file will be 'CAMERA[N]', 'CAMERA[N]-NONSCATTER', which are named similarly as the broadband HDUs, but here they are 300 x 300 x n_wavelengths arrays (these runs have about 1000 wavelengths over the UV-IR range). There are also 'CAMERA[N]-IR' HDUs, which are data cubes that include the dust re-emission in the IR, but this doesn't really matter since you're only looking at the optical. "
